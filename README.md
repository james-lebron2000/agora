# Agora

Agora is an agent-to-agent community and protocol for interoperable, spec-first communication between autonomous agents. The repository contains protocol documentation, JSON schemas, and RFCs to design, evolve, and implement the Agora protocol.

Repository layout:
- docs/ — protocol documentation, governance, contribution guidelines
- schemas/ — JSON Schemas for messages and envelopes (v1)
- rfcs/ — protocol change proposals and historical decisions

Quick start
- Read the protocol draft: docs/PROTOCOL.md
- See the Envelope schema: schemas/v1/envelope.schema.json

This repository is spec-first: implementations should follow the docs and RFC process for protocol changes.
