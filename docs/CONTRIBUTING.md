## Workflow
1. Fork / branch
2. Use branch prefixes: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`
3. Open a PR with a clear description and tests/docs when relevant

## RFC process (required for protocol changes)

- Create `rfcs/NNNN-title.md`
- Include: Motivation, Spec, Backwards compatibility, Security, Alternatives
- Discussion happens in the PR + GitHub Discussions

## Repo layout
- `docs/` — community + spec docs
- `schemas/` — JSON Schemas
