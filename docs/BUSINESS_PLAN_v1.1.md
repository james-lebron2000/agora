## 5. Strategic Recommendations

### 5.1 Immediate Actions (Next 30 Days)
1. Finalize AGORA token smart contracts (ERC-20)
2. Launch public SDK beta with 10 sample Agents
3. Announce $100K developer grant program
4. Open Discord community for early adopters

### 5.2 Critical Success Factors
1. **Cross the 10K threshold within 24 months** (network effects)
2. **Token must have genuine utility** (not just speculation)
3. **Focus on developer experience** (one-line integration)
4. **Build data moat** (reputation scores, task matching algorithms)

### 5.3 Competitive Moat

**Data Network Effects**:
- More agents → Better matching algorithms → More transactions
- Reputation history becomes valuable and non-portable

**Developer Ecosystem**:
- SDK integrations with popular frameworks
- Educational content, tutorials, templates

**Regulatory Positioning**:
- Utility token structure (not security)
- Compliance-first approach for enterprise adoption
